## Experimental

[@ramnathv](https://github.com/ramnathv) proposed a very interesting idea for simpler `htmlwidgets` in this [issue](https://github.com/ramnathv/htmlwidgets/issues/176) and then submitted some work to easily scaffold these simple widgets.  To top it all off, he adds some [`servr`](https://github.com/yihui/servr) magic to open these files in a live coding environment.  You have to see it ([Youtube demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6Wl-bqRSAU)) to believe it.

See the [example code](https://github.com/timelyportfolio/simple_widget_tests/blob/master/make_a_widget.R) that scaffolds a simple [`trianglify`](http://qrohlf.com/trianglify/) widget.
